## Scenario Overview
This scenario simulates a junior security intern ("Security Intern") working late at 5:30 PM ("End of Day"). The intern is rushing to complete final tasks before leaving, creating a state of high arousal and time pressure.

## Cognitive Focus
- **Time Pressure**: The explicit deadline (e.g., timesheets due by 6 PM) forces a speed-accuracy trade-off, encouraging heuristic processing over systematic processing.
- **Vigilance Decrement**: accumulated fatigue from the workday reduces the ability to spot subtle anomalies.
- **Authority Bias**: A mix of requests from HR, Team Leads, and "IT Support" challenges the intern's ability to verify sources under pressure.

## Purpose
This scenario exists to demonstrate how **cognitive depletion and urgency** can degrade decision quality, making even obvious phishing attempts successful if they leverage the right emotional triggers (urgency + authority).
