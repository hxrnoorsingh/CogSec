## Scenario Overview
This scenario simulates a "Senior SOC Analyst" working a monotonous night shift (2:00 AM). The analyst is bombarded with repetitive, false-positive prone alerts (Alert Fatigue), leading to a state of habituation where they automatically dismiss warnings without deep inspection.

## Cognitive Focus
- **Habituation**: responding less strongly to repeated stimuli over time.
- **Automation Bias**: trusting the system's "low priority" implicit classification or just following the "dismiss" pattern.
- **Vigilance Decrement**: difficulty maintaining attention during long, low-stimulation tasks.

## Purpose
To demonstrate how **repetitive noise** creates a security blind spot, allowing a high-fidelity signal (Mimikatz execution) to be dismissed as "just another glitch" or false positive.
