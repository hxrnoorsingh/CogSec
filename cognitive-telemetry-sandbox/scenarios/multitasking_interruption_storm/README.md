## Scenario Overview
This scenario simulates a "Project Manager" during a "storm" of interruptions. Slack messages and emails arrive simultaneously with calendar notifications.

## Cognitive Focus
- **Context Switching**: The mental cost of shifting focus from one task to another, which deletes working memory.
- **Split Attention**: attempting to process multiple information streams (Slack, Email) at once.

## Purpose
To demonstrate how **distraction** prevents the processing of security cues. The malicious link arrives in a Slack DM during a critical production issue, increasing the likelihood of an "automatic" click to resolve ambiguity.
