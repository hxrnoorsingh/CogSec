## Cognitive Focus
- **System 2 Processing**: slow, deliberate, analytical thinking.
- **Absence of Pressure**: allows for full inspection of security indicators.

## Purpose
To serve as a **control group** or baseline. Telemetry should show what "good" security decision-making looks like (high latency, correct identification).
